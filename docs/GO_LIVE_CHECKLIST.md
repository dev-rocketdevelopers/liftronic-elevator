## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Must Fix Before Launch

### 1. Email Template Logo URL

const LOGO_URL = "https://liftronic-elevator.vercel.app/_next/image?url=%2Fliftronic.png&w=96&q=75";
```

**Problem:** Hardcoded to Vercel preview domain. Will break in production.

**Solution:**
```typescript
const LOGO_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL 
  ? `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL}/liftronic.png`
  : "https://your-actual-domain.com/liftronic.png";
```

**Action Required:**

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
```

**Action Required:**

  secure: false,                    // false for port 587, true for 465
  user: "your-email@gmail.com",     // Sending email address
